Arlarm specification
====================

1. Purpose and scope
--------------------

Through this smartphone application, the user should be able to:
- set multiple labelled alarms
- set multiple labelled timers 

Note that, since the main purpose of the application is to implement the timepicker component, the rest of the app is of secondary priority and only loosely specified.

2. Timepicker
-------------

The idea of this timepicker component is to provide a quicker use than
Android's default picker. It attempts to accomplish this by presenting
circular sliders resembling the face of a clock: one for hours and one
for minutes. The usual spinner is present as well, to display the chosen
time numerically as well as to allow for stepwise adjustment.

One piece of specification that is not yet entirely clear, is how to
allow for am/pm picking without breaking the clock face analogy.

Specification
-------------

(Also see design sketches.)

The main area of the component consists of two circular slider controls,
one within the other. The inner is for hours and the outer is for
minutes. The inner is split in two rounds so that one round covers 12
hours and both am and pm can be chosen through the slider.

Above the circular sliders sits a traditional set of time picker
spinners, featuring triangular (arrowhead) buttons for stepwise
increment and decrement.

The spinner and the sliders are synchronized.
